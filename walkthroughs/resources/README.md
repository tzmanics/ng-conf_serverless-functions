# Resources

Here are a list of resources that I've discussed or forgot to but either way will hopefully be useful!

## Serverless Functions

- [Jason Lengstorf's Serverless Functions Workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/serverless-functions/)
- That same guy but with more people in [How to Build Dynamic Applications on the Jamstack with Serverless Functions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/05/26/how-to-build-dynamic-applications-on-the-jamstack-with-serverless-functions/)

## Serverless Architecture

- The holy grail imho of serverless resources: [CSS Tricks: The Power of Serverless for Front-end Developers](https://serverless.css-tricks.com)
- Martin Fowler's post on [Serverless Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)
